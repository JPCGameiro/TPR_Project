# How to install

1. Create a virtual environment (venv)
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment (you need to repeat this step, and this step only, every time you start a new terminal/session):
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the game requirements:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
